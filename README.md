go-ga
=====

This is a crappy project, one of my first in learning the GO langauge. It attempts to solve the traveling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm. 

_disclaimer_: This is a poor implementation that does not solve well. The parameters are all wrong and I caution anyone looking at this.
